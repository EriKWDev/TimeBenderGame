				<h2>Part 1 - She was born</h2>

				<p>Once upon a time in a world only little known by us, innocent people could live peacefully. No one had to suffer, no one had to worry, no one had to be sacrificed...<br>...and no one had to fear <i>him</i>.</p>

				<p>But that all changed one day.</p>

				<p>Amongs the normal people were once some few 'other' people, different people. Some called them <i>'The Specials'</i>, <i>'The Wise'</i> or <i>'The Blessed'</i>... Others knew them as <i>'Mistakes'</i> or even <i>'Devils'</i>. The only thing that everyone could agree on was the fact that they were powerful indeed...<br>
					No one had seen such a person for hundreds of years and their excistence had merely turned in to legend. Until Ellie Harton was born. Her hair was bright and almost glowing, her eyes were pure and reflected kindness. But her eyes were not normal eyes. They had something odd to them, they had the mark.</p>

				<p>No one could believe it or even think that it could be possible. For so many years had they been gone, but there, right in front of their eyes, was without doubt one of them. The word spread across the country. It reached people who didn't believe...</p>

				<i><p>"It can't be true that she is one of them, it's impossible. Impossible is what I say"<br>
					"That mother of hers must only be seeking money telling such ridiculous lies"<br>
					"Such nonsense should stay in the fairy tales it belongs to"</p></i>

				<p>...as well as people who did believe. It reached kind people...</p>

				<i><p>"We're blessed! A chance to have one of them amongs us is a sign from God"<br>
					"I hope she will be alright. Her powers are desired by many and that's not for the good I say..."</p></i>

				<p>...and it reached evil people who wanted her and her powers for themselves.</p>

				<i><p>"I think it's about time that we visited that girl..."<br>
					"Just imagine what we could become with the powers of one of them"</p></i>

				<p>The powers that Ellie possesed were indeed powerful and if used wisely they could be used for the good. The only problem was that there were no known others of her sort who could help her follow the right path, teach her how to not do bad. How to not hurt anyone.</p>

				<p>In order to keep Ellie safe from the evil persons who seeked her mighty powers, her mother and father decided to flee and hide. Hide Ellie from the world until she was ready.<br>
					With them followed an old man whom the parents knew called mr. Sprouse, a wise man who had researched about Ellie and her kind for many years in old archives, legends and folktales. He hoped to be of help in the managemant of Ellies upbringing and safety.<br>
					He brought food and medecine to the family and supplied them with all they needed to survive and live a somewhat normal life. He gave them a small house in the middle of a forest and he didn't tell anyone about their location. He only wanted the best for them and Ellie.<br>
					A year passed by and the family and mr. Sprouse had become used to their way of living. The Harton family had settled down in their small home and everything seemed as if nothing bad could ever happen.<br>
					However, one day mr. Sprouse entered their samll house to bring some good news, but what he saw when he opened the door was terrible.</p>

				<h2>Part 2 - The incident</h2>
				<p>What was in front of mr. Sprouse was not a nice scene. There was blood on the floor. Pictures had fallen of the walls, glass layed shattered everywhere. In the middle of the room layed two dead corpspes. It was mr. and mrs. Harton, covered in blood. But worst of all was not the dead parents, because in front of them was a much more terrifying sight. Little Ellie sat in a pool of blood playing with something small and shiny in her small one year old baby hands... In the dark room she turned around a bit and looked at mr. Sprouse and at the light he let in from the front door. She smiled.</p>
				
				<p>Mr. Sprouse was terrified and stood still locked in place as if in shock. He finally ran in to the building, picked up Ellie and ran away.</p>

				<h2>Part 3 - Ellie Harton's eyes</h2>
				<p>Mr. Sprouse had brought Ellie in to his home. He had washed the blood off of her in the lake in the forest. He couldn't let blood be seen in the town, especially not near his house. In fact, he couldn't let anything of Ellie be seen. Everyone knew that the Harton family had disappeared a year ago and still spoke about them and Ellie's powers.</p>
